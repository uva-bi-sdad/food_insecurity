# Food Insecurity
This repository is for a Census Use Case on Food Insecurity to demonstrate Curate Data Environment capabilities. The estimation uses the household living budget [HLB](https://github.com/uva-bi-sdad/household_living_budget) corresponding to the income necessary to meet a householdâ€™s needs to function at a modest yet adequate standard of living and pay federal and state income taxes. The publicly available data, references, and source code are used to estimate the number of households facing food insecurity for the 274 census tracts in Fairfax County, Virginia.
