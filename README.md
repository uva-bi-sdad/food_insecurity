# Food Insecurity
This repository contains the publicly available data, references, and source code to estimate food insecurity at the census tract level in Fairfax County, VA.
The estimation uses the household living budget (HLB) [HLB][https://github.com/vuejs/vue](https://github.com/uva-bi-sdad/household_living_budget) corresponding to the income necessary to meet a householdâ€™s needs to function at a modest yet adequate standard of living and pay federal and state income taxes.
